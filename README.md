  Task 2 (Landing page)  (https://task-landingpage.netlify.app/)
  
Through this project, I HAVE learned to create columns, divide
sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is
unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments,
padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping
elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills,
encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
