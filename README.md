Through this project, I HAVE learned to create columns, divide

padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping
elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills,
encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
